/** The strategies worth measuring, and what each one actually scored.
  *
  * Every val carries two metrics lines because one number cannot say whether a strategy works. `searched 2023-07..2025-07` is the two years
  * the GA folds cover, so for anything named `_optimized` it reports fit to the data that chose it and is not evidence of an edge.
  * `holdout 2025-12..2026-06` is the seven months nothing has ever scored or selected against; that is the line to read. Where the two
  * disagree sharply the strategy is fitted, not skilled — the clearest case here is s4_regime_optimized, PF 1.894 in-sample against 0.595
  * out, on a corpus where its whole family loses money. `BatchBacktester` prints a third section for the original twelve-month sample; it
  * is a subset of `searched` and is deliberately not recorded per val.
  *
  * Read the holdout column across strategies, not as a forecast. Its net figures cover seven months against the searched column's
  * twenty-four, so they are not comparable to each other, and nine of the thirteen vals post a lower profit factor there than in sample —
  * the usual overfitting story, but it also means the level of the whole column is a property of those seven months. What it supports is
  * ranking strategies against each other on data none of them was selected on. What it does not support is expecting those numbers forward.
  *
  * The four exceptions, whose holdout profit factor beats their in-sample one, are s2_optimized, s2_optimized_v3, s4_optimized_v2 and
  * s5_optimized_v2 — and three of those four lead the catalogue on holdout net. That is the pattern worth trusting: a strategy holding up
  * better on data nobody selected it on than on the data that chose it was not fitted to the folds.
  *
  * Both lines were re-measured on 2026-08-25 when the folds went from three to six and reporting moved to the holdout, and re-verified
  * unchanged on 2026-08-27. They are not comparable to figures quoted in commit history or in `ga-optimisation-*.md` reports before
  * 2026-08-25: the earlier "searched" column was one year rather than two, and the earlier out-of-sample column was the whole newer export,
  * a third of which is the validation fold every champion's finalist ranking selected on.
  *
  * Version suffixes neither rank a family nor run contiguously within one. The catalogue was pruned to its measured winners on 2026-08-27,
  * and where a GA descendant beat the base it came from, the descendant was promoted into the base's name and the base deleted — so
  * `s1_v2_optimized` here is the champion of ga-optimisation-2026-08-24-1855, not the val that report was searching. The same prune left
  * `s5_optimized_v2` as the only member of its family, with no `s5_optimized` above it. A suffix therefore records only that a val once
  * needed distinguishing from something; the report filename in each comment is the stable link back, and the holdout line is the ranking.
  *
  * One val survives the sixteen rounds of 2026-08-25/26: s5_optimized_v2, which ranked ninth of the fourteen champions those rounds
  * selected and breached five constraints, and which now posts the best holdout profit factor and Sharpe in this file. Of the other
  * thirteen, two beat the base they came from and the rest were deleted; nine had a training fitness of exactly 0.000000, meaning the six
  * search folds scored them at zero and the four-month validation fold ranked them alone, and the round with the highest validation fitness
  * and the only clean constraint verdict of the batch returned a quarter of its base's holdout net. Two rounds selected nothing at all.
  * Treat a validation figure from that generation of rounds as a filter that rejects, not as a ranking.

  // Trend + low-volatility filters screen out ranging markets. Ride each position until the Ichimoku
  // trend actually reverses — no trailing stop, no time cap.

  // EXIT REDESIGN: the original s12 exited on a Parabolic SAR flip (afMax=0.3, very aggressive) OR a
  // trend reversal, giving W/L 0.74 and total profit 0.06177 over majors1h. The SAR and every time-cap
  // variant tested were amputating the fat tail of winning trend trades. Exiting ONLY on a position-gated
  // Ichimoku trend reversal lifts total profit to 0.28206, W/L to 1.22355, and cuts orders 490 -> 156
  // (5 of 6 majors profitable). The Parabolic SAR indicator was consequently removed as dead weight.
